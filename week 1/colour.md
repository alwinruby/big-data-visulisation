# Choice of colour

We believe it’s possible to match the visual format of a visualisation with the cognitive process used to understand it.

We can also refer to a set of design principles which ask what cognitive processes are involved.

In particular to:

* provide effective cognitive support it’s essential to understand the cognitive process of a particular task in association with attributes of the end user and the visual representation.

* develop a set of design principles asking what cognitive processes should be part of the evaluation.


The choice of colour for your visualisation is very important when communicating information. Poor colour choice can result in an ineffective comparison which entirely confuses your audience.

While there is a strong aesthetic component to colour, when using colour to convey information we need to think about the following questions:

1. What information are you trying to convey?

2. How (or whether) can colour enhance it?

Colour can be attached to emotional response and colours can mean different things to different cultures.
