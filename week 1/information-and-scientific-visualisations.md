# Introducing information and scientific visualisations


### What is information visualisation?

Information visualisation, or InfoVis, uses data that have an underlying structure. It relates to the physical world and amplifies human cognition by visualising relational graphs (such as networks), tables, time series, documents, personal data and much more.

By learning about the tradition of representing information through pictures using art and science you’ll extract knowledge and information that was not immediately obvious from visual representations of abstract data.


examples :

William Playfair, English political economist, published The Statistical Breviary

Dr John Snow plotted the locations of cholera deaths

Charles Joseph Minard’s visualisation of 1864 exports of French wine

### What is scientific visualisation?


Scientific visualisation copes with the problem of extracting knowledge and getting insight from the results of numerical simulations, computations, measurements or real-world processes.

Scientific visualisation works with data comprised of spatial variables from the real-world where as infoVis works with abstract data made-up of non-spatial variables. Otherwise, there is a lot that is very similar. Scientific visualisation usually involves a series of complex data processing operations to eventually produce an image, plot or animated sequence. We can use this output for many purposes including:

* answering a well-defined question
* revealing a fact that was not known before
* aiding cognition of data.

Nowadays, scientific data visualisation is an extensive field at the cross-section of mathematics, physics, engineering, computer science, cognitive and perception sciences. Many scientific disciplines (from signal processing, imaging through computer graphics to statistics) share its principles.

So, what can we actually achieve through scientific visualisation?
The objectives of scientific visualisation could be defined as to:

* make things look realistic
* showcase the data or demonstrate a trend or trends
* facilitate exploration.
