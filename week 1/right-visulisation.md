# Choosing the right form of visualisation


The best visualisations use representations that match the data. However, choosing the right form of visualisation isn’t always easy.

The Periodic table of elements, originally created by Dimitri Mendeleev, reflects the nature of the chemical elements to determine its layout. Each row in the table shows the number of electron shells and electrons for each element.

__Use of standard methods__

There are many well-known effective visualisation methods, for example, line graphs and bar charts, but here are two others which were introduced by Edward Tufte.


1. Sparklines

Large datasets often require comparisons. One way to show comparison is to use sparklines. They are small, concise, have no y-axis, fit into a line of text, and can be created in web browsers with tools such as D3.js. They’re designed to fit into the text around them without additional explanation.

2. Small multiples

Small multiples are copies of charts and are presented alongside each other to facilitate comparison. They represent multiple sets of variables for one dataset. Tufte originally described them as:

‘Illustrations of postage-stamp size are indexed by category or a label, sequenced over time like the frames of a movie, or ordered by a quantitative variable not used in the single image itself.’
