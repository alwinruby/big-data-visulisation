### What do we want from visualisation?

__Visualisation focuses on techniques for presenting data in visual ways to support understanding of the underlying patterns, whether it’s done for research, science or for decision makers.__


We can use visualisation to:

* Display information
    * photographs, plots, trends


* Analyse data to support reasoning
    * develop and assess hypotheses
    * discover errors in data
    * expand memory
    * find patterns
    * make decisions.


* Communicate
    * share and persuade
    * collaborate and revise.


* Information visualisation aims to display data in a way that highlights the information the presenter wants to convey to the viewer.


* Scientific visualisation aims to display scientific information and results in a way that helps to convey the scientific insights. We’ll see how this can be similar to, or quite different from, information visualisation. For example, scientific visualisation can be useful when combining models with observational data and showing the content of various databases created as a result of data processing algorithms in various fields. There are so many areas in which this is useful! Think of:

    * health and disease exposures
    * transport and infrastructure optimisation
    * emergency monitoring
    * forensics
    * aviation
    * air quality monitoring
    * biomedical imaging
    * radiation therapy.


* Visual analytics is an active area of visualisation research that combines analytical reasoning with the strengths of information visualisation, scientific visualisation and the outcomes of modelling.
