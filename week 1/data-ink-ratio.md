# Data:Ink ratio

Edward Tufte, author of several books about visualising data, says we should use the least amount of ink to display data or the fewest number of pixels. The ink (or pixels) that can be removed without any loss of information is what Tufte calls chartjunk.

Chartjunk is the excessive use of visual embellishments. It’s often used to cover the fact that your data aren’t interesting but it can also be confusing and even deliberately misleading.

For example, 2D information can have an additional 3D perspective which doesn’t help to communicate the data at all. The y-axis can be scaled to give an impression of a large or small effect.

Ultimately, visualisations should save time and mental effort in processing data.
