### What do we want from visualisation?

__Visualisation focuses on techniques for presenting data in visual ways to support understanding of the underlying patterns, whether it’s done for research, science or for decision makers.__


We can use visualisation to:

Display information
photographs, plots, trends
Analyse data to support reasoning
develop and assess hypotheses
discover errors in data
expand memory
find patterns
make decisions.
Communicate
share and persuade
collaborate and revise.
Information visualisation aims to display data in a way that highlights the information the presenter wants to convey to the viewer.

Scientific visualisation aims to display scientific information and results in a way that helps to convey the scientific insights. We’ll see how this can be similar to, or quite different from, information visualisation. For example, scientific visualisation can be useful when combining models with observational data and showing the content of various databases created as a result of data processing algorithms in various fields. There are so many areas in which this is useful! Think of:

health and disease exposures
transport and infrastructure optimisation
emergency monitoring
forensics
aviation
air quality monitoring
biomedical imaging
radiation therapy.
Visual analytics is an active area of visualisation research that combines analytical reasoning with the strengths of information visualisation, scientific visualisation and the outcomes of modelling.


## What can I do with visual analytics?

__Visual analytics connects the strengths of visualisation and analytical reasoning to help with decision-making. This can support understanding the results of experiments and simulations, and show the content of databases in meaningful ways.__


Visual analytics allows exploration of data through both visualisation and theoretical models to generate new knowledge. The result often produces a graphical interface illustrating the trends and change in data over time. It’s effectively used to communicate the message to non-expert users.

In general, visual analytics focuses on:

* Various analytical techniques allowing users to obtain comprehensive insights that explicitly support decision making and assessment.

* Interactive techniques and visual representations allowing users to explore data and possibly understand underlying patterns at once.

* Various techniques used for production, presentation and communication of the analytical reasoning in a specific context for a targeted audience.

* Transformations and representations of data to support analysis and visualisation.
Quantitative visualisation, for instance in measurement science, where measurements can be done directly on the visualisation of data.

* Different views of the data where different representations of the same data can uncover different patterns.

* Collaborative aspects, for instance when people from different geographical locations can operate on the same data and make decisions.

_*Visual analytics isn’t a crystal ball; value can only be extracted when there is a precise problem to be addressed. It may happen that only 5% of the data has a value that supports decision-making or explains specific phenomena.*_

Scientific visualisation, information visualisation and visual analytics are all useful to help their users gain insight. But insight is difficult to measure and may be one element in working with a visualisation. A more tangible measure of successful visualisation is how much time it saves the user.
