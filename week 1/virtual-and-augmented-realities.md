#  What is the difference between virtual and augmented realities?

Immersive environments, in particular virtual and augmented realities, are providing exciting new ways of seeing our world. In a scientific context, the challenge is how to use such environments to solve large-scale problems and make this world a better place.


Virtual reality (VR) is often described as immersive or computer-simulated reality that replicates an environment and simulates a physical presence in the real or virtual world. In the VR scenes users are usually equipped with the ability to interact with virtual objects through artificially created sensory experiences. These experiences include sight, touch, hearing and smell.


Augmented reality (AR) provides a digital enhancement on the physical world, specifically in situations where images and information augment what the user sees. AR falls into two broad technological categories: 2D information overlays and 3D presentations. AR contains the following key elements:

* Presence: the augmented reality needs to know the user’s location (physical or virtual) in order to work properly. Use of physical markers is sometimes necessary for proper location estimation.

* Registration and image acquisition: after the augmented reality system recognises where the user is looking, the overlaying images must be properly aligned and matched.


### Jaguar VR Application

Many eyes on the wild is the story about a group of field researchers who ventured into the Peruvian Amazon to help conserve jaguars. They contributed to jaguar conservation by bringing together new virtual reality technology, mathematical and statistical modelling, local knowledge and international expertise. The researchers:

used new 360-degree camera setups to take images of the jungle
used these images to elicit information about jaguars from locals and international experts
used this information to develop statistical and mathematical models about the location and abundance of jaguars and how they’re faring
shared this information with big cat charity, Panthera, to help establish the Peruvian leg of a Pan American jaguar corridor.
The JaguarVR application is available for download from the website Many eyes on the wild. Here is a brief overview.

“When you start the JaguarVR application, you will see a scene, like the one below with beautiful Amazonian jungle in the background. You will see a jaguar walking on the map of Peru, and set of banners floating in the space and acting as “teleportation” menu items. Use your body and head rotation, to navigate within the scene. Look around, look left and right, up and down, and all the way behind you, to familiarise yourself with the Virtual Reality scenes.

In the centre of the screen, you will always see a green cross that allows you to interact with the scenes. When the cross changes colour to red, it indicates interaction with the objects in Virtual Reality.

If you see an “i” icon on the big panel, it means the scene has a voice over – click on “i” and you will hear a voice describing the scene. When you click on “TICK” the panel will be closed and you can look at the scene behind. Don’t forget to look around!

What will happen when you put the cross on the jaguar? Find out yourself.”
