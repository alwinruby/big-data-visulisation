## What can I do with visual analytics?

__Visual analytics connects the strengths of visualisation and analytical reasoning to help with decision-making. This can support understanding the results of experiments and simulations, and show the content of databases in meaningful ways.__


Visual analytics allows exploration of data through both visualisation and theoretical models to generate new knowledge. The result often produces a graphical interface illustrating the trends and change in data over time. It’s effectively used to communicate the message to non-expert users.

In general, visual analytics focuses on:

* Various analytical techniques allowing users to obtain comprehensive insights that explicitly support decision making and assessment.

* Interactive techniques and visual representations allowing users to explore data and possibly understand underlying patterns at once.

* Various techniques used for production, presentation and communication of the analytical reasoning in a specific context for a targeted audience.

* Transformations and representations of data to support analysis and visualisation.
Quantitative visualisation, for instance in measurement science, where measurements can be done directly on the visualisation of data.

* Different views of the data where different representations of the same data can uncover different patterns.

* Collaborative aspects, for instance when people from different geographical locations can operate on the same data and make decisions.

_*Visual analytics isn’t a crystal ball; value can only be extracted when there is a precise problem to be addressed. It may happen that only 5% of the data has a value that supports decision-making or explains specific phenomena.*_

Visualisation is used as a checkpoint and is adjusted depending on users’ interactions. Its outcome can be directly used to improve the building of the analytical models by a mutual visualisation-analytics feedback loop (for instance, a user can click on regions of maps that are essential for updating the model’s computations). Combining these techniques in effective ways generates new knowledge that can be used for decision-making.
