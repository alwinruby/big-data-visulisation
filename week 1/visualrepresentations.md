# Visual representations


__Different visual representations can be used to focus attention on particular properties or the underlying patterns of the datasets being studied.__

Consider how colour, size, networks, time and simulation and level of detail can be applied to visually represent different examples of datasets.

**Colour**

Choosing the right colour for your visualisation is important for perception. A presentation or visualisation can be enhanced and clarified through an appropriate choice of colour. On the other hand, poor use of colour can obscure and confuse the audience.

When visualising temperature values, using a range of colours from blue to red can be interpreted as ranging from cold to hot.

Consider:

* How will your visualisation look when printed on a grayscale printer?

* How will a person with red and green colour blindness view your presentation?

**Size**

Size is one of the most important features when visually representing or mapping data. Use size to easily differentiate between two objects

**Location and spatial information**

New text and links: In applying visual representation, location can be represented by attaching or linking datasets to a map or a virtual place.

This map of Queensland shows the representation of relative risk of death within 5 years of diagnosis for all invasive cancers of males. It visualises clearly the most affected regions by using both colours and location.

**Networks**

Networks are another way of mapping data to visually represent graphs. Networks show connections between data points, identify relationships and can reveal clusters. Network visualisations have been successfully used to map connections between friends, concepts and even between ideas and inspirations.

**Time and simulation**


Data can change over time. For example, consider our changing temperatures or currency exchange rates. If the dataset we’re trying to represent is changing, we’ll need to consider using animation to visually represent the ‘transient’ behaviour in the mapping phase.


**Level of detail (LOD)**

Level of detail is another concept to be considered when mapping your data to visualisations. Even though some users are content with a summary of information, using LOD in visualisations allows users to zoom in for greater detail and out for less detail.

LOD allows the user to quickly navigate through a visualisation and not worry about details initially, especially when detailed visualisation requires re-computations or additional processing time.

The use of computational steering of a visualisation allows the user to drive the visualisation. This can be as simple as zooming in/out, rotating the image, specifying the starting point for a streamline, or changing a parameter value in a simulation.
